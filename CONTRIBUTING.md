## Pull Request Process

1. If what you're working it's not covered by a issue yet, create the issue, and tell us that you're working with this problem.
2. Make sure to keep your commits as clean as possible, no "Fix bug" or "Ident code". Squash them if necessary.
3. If there's any notable exception in your PR, that's not understandable by reading only your commit messages, use the description area in the PR to document it. 
4. Link your issue in the PR.  
5. Ensure any install or build dependencies, and IDE config files are not included in the PR.
6. Update the README.md with details of changes to the code or ambient setting, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and eventual new commands.
